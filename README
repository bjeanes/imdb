A simple ruby library to scrape IMDB

USAGE:

movie = Imdb.new('die hard 2')

puts "IMDB ID: #{movie.imdb_id}"
puts "Title: #{movie.title}"
puts "Plot: #{movie.plot}"
puts "Runtime: #{movie.rated}"
puts "Rating: #{movie.rating}"
puts "Image URL: #{movie.image_url}"



Thats about all it does. its simple. I only made it to work with another project.
